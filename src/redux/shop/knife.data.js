They are very similar to the common western paring or utility knife and are adept at many small and detailed cutting tasks. Petties are also perfect for preparing garnishes and other artistic cutting tasks. This very light and nimble knife is the epitome of a Konosuke blade. You owe it to yourself to try one!",

The blade is a mono-steel construction using HD2, semi-stainless steel. The heat treat on the blade is in the range of 61 HRC. As mentioned the grinds and geometry on this knife are designed for high performance, and boy does it deliver! This knife is not only thin at the spine, but it is insanely thin behind the edge. Couple the thinness of the blade with the steel's ability to take and hold a rather acute sharpening angle, and you are in for a real treat!",

It defines a class with its amazing grind, simple elegance, and extreme abilities. It’s a laser, so it is ultra-thin. But it is still a rigid and responsive knife. The grind is slightly convex and it manifests this in an ability to make food molecules part before it! This kiritsuke version of the classic HD gyuto is a rare beast and in many circles a most desirable one. The obvious physical difference is the kiritsuke tip. It makes for a more blade-forward balance while enhancing its cutting capabilities, especially with more intricate food preparations. It looks super cool too",

As the name implies, Aogami Super, or “AS,” is found at the core of these knives which receive a stainless lamination, greatly increasing the anti-corrosive properties and ease of maintenance associated with these blades. The AS core allows the smith to put an incredibly acute edge on these blades, which can be taken to high levels of refinement and exhibit excellent retention. Very thin and light, these knives fly through ingredients. The smoother kurouchi finish on the Stainless series also reduces drag through ingredients, enhancing the performance of this fantastic petty.",
